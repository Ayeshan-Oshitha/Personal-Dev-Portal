## ‚ùì What was easy and what was hard?

Most of the project was easy. Since I had previously worked with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, building the project was smooth and familiar.

However, there were two parts that were more difficult:

- **Styling with grid and flexbox** ‚Äì It was a bit tricky to align and structure some sections properly.
- **Deploying a preview branch on Vercel** ‚Äì I managed to deploy the `feature/dev-portal` branch successfully, but only I could view the preview. I still need to figure out how to make that preview publicly accessible.

## ü§ñ What did AI help you with?

AI helped me with several things:

- Generating logic, like the real-time timer
- Creating initial versions of API call functions
- Explaining code and fixing bugs

Although I edited and refined the suggestions myself, AI definitely saved time and provided good starting points.

## üö´ What suggestions did you reject and why?

Sometimes I rejected GitHub Copilot suggestions because:

- The generated code was incomplete (e.g., missing closing tags)
- The output didn‚Äôt match what I needed or was not aligned with my design goals

In those cases, I preferred to write or refactor the code manually.

## ‚è±Ô∏è What would you add if you had more time?

If I had more time, I would:

- Improve the overall UI and styling
- Enhance light/dark theme support
- Add animations using **Framer Motion** for smoother transitions
- Build more components to expand the site‚Äôs functionality
